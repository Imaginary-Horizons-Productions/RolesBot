## Style
- This project uses tabs for indentation to reduce file size and keypresses during code navigation
- Bot feedback messages should be written in 3rd-person passive tense and make requests in polite language
    - Example: "Your bounty could not be posted. Please remove phrases disallowed by the server from the title and try again."
