# RolesBot
A modern light-weight Discord bot for allowing server members to select their own roles.

## Set-up
1. [Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=962118195299356722&permissions=2415929344&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to add RolesBot to your server!
2. Move the bot's role above all roles it should be able to give/remove but under any roles of people who are going to manage the bot
3. Use `/register-role` on all the roles the bot should be able to give
4. Use `/roles-message` in roles (make sure the bot has permission to send messages in that channel)
